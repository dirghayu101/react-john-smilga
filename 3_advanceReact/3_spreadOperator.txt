You can override a specific value using spread operator like in this snippet of code:
    const MyComponent = () => {
        const [person, setPerson] = useState({name: "Joshi", age: 21, hobby: "Reading books."});

        const changePerson = () => {
            setPerson({...person, name: "Rahul"});  //In this case.
        }
    }
