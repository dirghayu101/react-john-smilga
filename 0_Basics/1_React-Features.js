/* 
1. COMPONENTS: The first version code of kickstart used plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. It was a pain to debug. React is all about splitting the big chunk of code into components.

2. INDEPENDENCE: Each component is like a unit in itself and stores all the logic for particular functioning. If you have to make some changes, you will just change that component and all the instances of the component will change automatically.

3. REUSABILITY: You don't need to write the same code for buttons of similar types in all your project, you can simply import those buttons after creating a component for them once.

4. SPEED: Since react just updates the component upon re-rendering, it increases the speed.
