    #The Difference between npm and npx:
    
        -> npm (short for Node Package Manager) is a command-line tool that comes bundled with Node.js, which is used for installing, managing, and sharing packages (or libraries) of code written in JavaScript. It is mainly used to manage dependencies for a project and can be used to install and manage both global and local packages.

        -> npx (short for Node Package Runner) is also a command-line tool that comes bundled with npm, but it is used for running packages or commands without installing them globally. npx downloads packages from the npm registry and then executes them. It is useful for running command-line tools that are not installed globally or for running a package with a specific version without having to install it.

        -> npm is used for installing and managing packages, while npx is used for executing packages without having to install them globally.
